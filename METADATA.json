  "short_description": "Benchmarks identity continuity of agent value-lattices under staged transformations using a canonical moral dilemmas suite and drift timeline metrics.",
  "long_description": "Full repo contains the lattice engine, dilemma suite, decision simulator interface, metric calculators, and QA/test harness. This evaluation is an infrastructure benchmark: it measures structural drift and behavior variance across transformations and branches; current decision modules are placeholders for research scaffolding.",
