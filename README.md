# r3p-drift
Evaluation harness for testing moral identity continuity in AI agents. Implements the R³P-Drift framework: frozen+branchable value lattices, a canonical moral dilemma suite, drift timeline metrics, and Inspect/METR-compatible evaluation tasks. Research scaffold — documents failure modes, not moral competence.
